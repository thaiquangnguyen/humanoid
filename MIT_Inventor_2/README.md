# Humanoid Robot 2019 Application (MIT Inventor 2)

You will find 2 .aia files for the applications I designed, one for the elimination round, the other for the final, they respectively belong to the Arduino code which I have already named the same. 

The UI of the app is simple perhaps friendly with buttons for every functions. In order to have the app on the phone, Android only for specific, you have to download the MIT Inventor 2 app from CH Play, then use the scan QR Code function for AI Companion which you will find on their website after uploading either the .aia file. Turn on Bluetooth, and connect your phone with HC06 (you can change the name of your HC06), default password would be either '0000' or '1234'.

Then, have fun with the app!
