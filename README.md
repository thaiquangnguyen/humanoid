# BKBOT - HUMANOID ROBOT BACH KHOA 2019

I had been involving in this competition in my university - Ho Chi Minh University of Technology, Viet Nam. The competition was held by a club which I was a member of - Bach Khoa Robotics & Automation. 

This was one of the first times I had ever challenged myself in a robotic game, thus we made to final ground and won the first prize. In a team of 3, I would like to thank them for hard works and dedication, as a leader I hope that some days we would be reuniting in an even greater contest and making more pride. Therefore, I make a repository of how we did it, hope it is helpful. 

Thank you, Quan and Long, for believing in this team.
