The design of the robot came relatively alike the one in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKomQx1O5kU

For the elimination round, we use this design:

For the final round, we use this:

The components list alters to every round but you can find all of the parts in stores without any obstacles. For the feet, we used the 3D-printed feet from Instructables https://www.instructables.com/id/Small-Humanoid-Robot-Making/, you can find the .stl file here, I also uploaded it above.
